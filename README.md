# Machine Learning from Scratch: Regressions
This project is a deep dive into fundamental ML concepts, built from the ground up.

# 💡 Key Idea
I am convinced that to truly excel in Machine Learning, you must understand how algorithms work under the hood. This repository is my journey from mathematical theory to optimized code.

# 🗺️ Roadmap
The project is divided into three evolutionary stages:
1. Logic Implementation: Pure Python implementation using loops to understand the mechanics of Gradient Descent.
2. Optimized Version: Transitioning to Vectorization with NumPy for high-performance computing.
3. Benchmark & Analysis: Comparing both methods using performance metrics and visual graphics.
