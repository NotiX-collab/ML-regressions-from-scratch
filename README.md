# ML-regressions-from-scratch
This project tells about how basic ML concepts I divided it into 3 parts.

## Key idea
I'm sure that if you want to be good at Machine Learning you need to know how it works under the hood.
## Road map
1. Logic implementation using loops
2. Optimized version (Vectorization)
3. Comparing these two methods using graphics.
